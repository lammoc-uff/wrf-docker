	* Maintenance release of stable 2.0.2 release
	* src/gasdf.c: updated to 2.1.a2 release with fixes problem when
	  lev units is "hPa"
	* extensions: upgraded to 2.1.a2 extensions (see below)
	* documentation: upgraded to 2.1.a2 documentation

2014-06-04 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.1.a2.oga.1
	* Notice that we have skipped v2.1.a1
	* added path.gex extension under ams/
	* merged with v2.1.a2 from COLA
	  Features:
	   * Update option for gribmap (-u) has been restored
           * New options for gribmap to up/downgrade the index file version;
	     this enables gribmap updates without having to rescan data files
           * New option for 'set sdfwrite' to specify an unlimited dimension
           * New option for 'set sdfwrite' to force a 3-dimensional output file
           * Added 'q fgvals' to return colors and values specified with 'set fgvals'
           Bugs:
           * Checks if hdf5 format is chunked before checking chunking parameters
           * Checks for valid image file before creating a custom tile
	* implicitly incorporate features from 2.1.a1:
	  Features:	
	   * All the graphics, including the interactive X window display and 
	     all image and hardcopy output, are now handled by the Cairo library.
	   * New command 'gxprint' -- all-purpose printing command that handles all output formats
	   * New hardcopy output options with gxprint: PDF and SVG
	   * External utilities gxps, gxeps, gxtran are obsolete
	   * Commands 'enable print', 'print', and 'disable print' are obsolete
	   * The 'printim' command is now an alias for 'gxprint'
           * Added options to 'set rgb' to support transparent colors and patterns	
           * Added options to 'set font' to define new fonts
           * New command 'set hershey' -- enables generic fonts that are analogs of Hershey fonts 
	   * New command 'set lwid' -- defines a new line thickness setting 
	   * New command 'set tile' -- enables pattern filling for shaded contours
	   * New command 'set antialias' -- temporarily disables anti-aliasing (not recommended)
	   * The interactive display is always in color mode. The 'set display' command 
	     is now only for swapping the background and foreground colors
	   * Major redesign of the graphics code to make graphics rendering more "pluggable"
	   * The widgets (buttons, drop menus, and rubber bands) have been temporarily disabled
	   Misc:
	   * Added new mark #12, a closed diamond
	   * Added check for hPa unit in sdfopen
	   * Added thickness option to 'set grid' command
	   Bugs:

2014-04-23 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.2.oga.1
	* added Poisson Solver to shfilt extension; fixed wrappijg bug in sh_filt().
	* added TLE extension, similar to ORB extension but based on TLE files
	* merged with v2.0.2 from COLA
	  Features:
            * New function amax() returns the maximum grid value over an X-Y region.
	    * New function amaxlocx() returns the the X location of the maximum grid 
	      value over an X-Y region.
	    * New function amaxlocy() returns the the Y location of the maximum grid 
	      value over an X-Y region.
	    * New function amin() returns the minimum grid value over an X-Y region.
	    * New function aminlocx() returns the the X location of the minimum grid 
	      value over an X-Y region.
	    * New function aminlocy() returns the the Y location of the minimum grid 
	      value over an X-Y region.
	    * New function atot() combines the latitude-weighting capability in aave()
	      with the summing capability of asum().
	    * New features added to lterp() based on regrid2() and re(): a bessel interpolation 
	      may be added to the bilinear option, plus new options for an area average using 
	      aave or amean.
	    * Added support for GRIB2 Probability & Aerosol products (Product Definition 
	      Templates 5, 9, and 48).
	      These templates require a third set of codes in the variable declaration of the 
	      descriptor file.
	    * grib2scan prints out relevant codes and suggests a variable declaration 
	       entry for descriptor file.
	    * Colorization of scatter plots enabled by using a third argument: 'display x;y;c'.

	    * For Robinson Projection, longitude may range from 0 to 360 as well as -180 to 180.
	    * Changed hard-coded 3.1415... to M_PI. 
	    * Tweaks to verbose output from gribmap to help diagnose unmatched records.
	    * When sdfopen/xdfopen is checking for Z axis, if pressure
	      units of Pa is detected, 	units will convert to mb automatically. 
	      Notice to user printed.
	    Bugs:
	    * Fixed I/O when reading 2-byte data.
	    * Fixed EDEF handling in sdfopen/xdfopen. 
	    * Fixed ensemble name parsing error.
	    * Fixed sdfopen/xdfopen to reject files with 360-day calendar attribute.
	    * Fixed streamlines to improve density handling for grid boxes that are very elongated, 
	      such as at high latitudes, or in vertical cross sections.  
	
2011-10-25 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.1.oga.1
	* bug fix by cola: src/gagmap.c

	* added sgrads (Secure GrADS) for web services
	* extensions/mf - updated from wxmap2 repo on 10/7/11
	* merged with v2.0.0 from COLA
	Features:
	    * New shaded contouring algorithm: "set gxout shade2"
	      Polygons are closed, have no holes, do not overlap, and are as large and few in number as is feasible 
	      Use of -1 for a color # will suppress drawing of the shaded contour, making it effectively transparent
	    * Legacy shaded contouring routine: "set gxout shade1" 
	    * "set gxout shaded" is now an alias for legacy shaded contouring routine
	    * Support for creating polygon shapefiles with new option "-poly" to "set shp" command 
	    * Support for creating polygon KML files with new option "-poly" to "set kml" command 
	    * 1D loglog plots with new command "set log1d"
	    * New environment variable GASHP, contains 1 or more directories that may contain shapefiles.
	      GASHP delimiters are space, semicolon, comma, or colon. Algorithm is:
	        1. Tries to open filename as provided by user	 
	        2. Parses GASHP and prepends each dir to filename
	        3. Prepends GADDIR directory (only one dir) to filename    
	    * New command "set strmopts" to control streamline density plus arrowhead spacing, size, and type. 
	      Support for negative streamline density values (between -10 and -1) for high-res grids. 
	 Misc:
	    * Mixed case ensemble names are now allowed
	    * Changes to improve masked contour labeling; also now works with "set vpage"
	    * Support for grib1 time range indicator 7, which subtracts the forecast time 
	      from the basetime to get the valid time
	    * Loosened restrictions in gribmap for mapping monthly data
	    * Previously undocumented command: "screen"
	    * Added "query calendar" command to discover calendar mode (unset, 365-day, or standard)
	    * Added ":" to list of delimiters for multiple dirs in GASCRP environment variable (now same as GASHP)
	    * Added "NULL" as an option for scale factor attribute name in the UNPACK descriptor file entry 
	      when add offset occurs alone
	    * Updated wgrib.c to version 1.8.1.2a
	    * Updated grib2scan to show start/ending times for averages, and valid times for instantaneous fields
	    * Handles GRIB2 Product Definition Template 4.15
	    * Added aliases 'line' for 'ln' and 'point' for 'pt' in 'set shp' and 'set kml' commands
	    * Added alias 'image' for 'img' in 'set kml' command
	 Bugs Fixed:
	    * Fixed errors when retrieving data from a very large defined object that has more than 2Gb elements.
	    * Patched memory leak when reading NetCDF attributes with lengths larger than 128
	    * Patched memory leaks in cdiff(), gr2stn(), and coll2gr() functions and collect() command
	    * Cannot have a leap and no-leap file open at the same time
	    * Calendar mode cleared with "reinit" only 
	    * Fixed big/little endian error when reading 2-byte binary data
	    * Fixed bug where 2-point contour segments are not drawn in upper right corner of grid
	    * Fixed contouring bug for very high res grids with vertices too close together to resolve graphically
	    * Fixed contouring bug for small grids that left a gap in contour line
	    * Added check for strictly increasing contour levels 
	    * Fixed streamlines in areas where grid boxes are not square (e.g. near the poles)
	    * Disabled erroneous vector/barb drawing in some projections (mollweide, orthographic, and robinson)
	    * Fixed erroneous results from 'q xy2gr' for some projections (returns -999.9 instead of garbage)
	

2010-10-03 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.a9.oga.1
	* extensions/lats: updated lats_grid in liblats.c to use gaexpr;
	  this was need for 2.0.a9 because of some internal error in grads.
	* extensions/mf: downgraded ftn_grhilo.F to version in 2.0.a8.oga.1
	  because new version has some array bound issues.
	* extensions/shape: no longer built as this functionality can now
	  be found in the main GrADS codebase.
	* Merged OpenGrADS codebase with v2.0.a9 from COLA:
	Features:
	    * Support for creating shapefiles with new commands: 
	      set gxout shp, set shp, clear shp, set shpattr, q shpopts
	    * New option '-ln' to 'set kml' to write out a KML file containing 
	      contours (this option is always enabled)
	    * New forecast templates:
	      %fn2  forecast minutes 
	      %fhn  forecast time in hhnn (hours and minutes)
	      %fdhn forecast time in ddhhnn (days, hours, and minutes) 
	    * New option '-a' on startup to set the aspect ratio of the 
	      graphics page 
	    * new option '-C' on startup to colorize text in command window
	Misc:
	    * Default dimensions of printim changed to reflect page's aspect ratio
	    * Files that are templated on E but not T do not have to be padded 
	      with missing data if ensembles do not have same start/end times 
	      (for binary and SDF formats)
	    * Change to 'set sdfwrite' -- no dimension padding if -4d and -5d 
	      are not used
	    * Support for grib files with time unit code 13 or 14 for 15-min 
	      and 30-min increments
	    * Updated doc files in src distribution
	    * Changes to configuration scripts

	From COLA's e-mail announcement for 2.0.a7:
	------------------------------------
	* New interface for the HDF5 data format 
	      http://iges.org/grads/gadoc/SDFdescriptorfile.html
	* New options for templating on Julian Day and Time axis indices
	      http://iges.org/grads/gadoc/templates.html
	* New "offt" syntax for variable specification to express time as an 
          offset from the variable's initial time instead of an absolute value
              http://iges.org/grads/gadoc/variable.html
              http://iges.org/grads/gadoc/offt.html

	* configure.ac: removed XLIBEMU, added geotiff support
	* Makefile.am: add bundle creating targets
	* grads.c: renamed main() --> Main(); Java patches have been
	  overwitten for the moment; initialized UDXT package.
	* gafunc.c: reintroduced UDXT hooks
	* gauser.c: ditto
	* gxmeta.c: hooks for on-line gxyat
	* pytests: added OPeNDAP tests, including for station data.
	* bundle/: utilities for handling bundles

2009-02-11 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.a4.oga.4

	* gasdf.c: fixed bug that cause coredump on x86_64
	* configure.ac: mods for netcdf-4 build
	* Makefile.am: same
	* gaudx.c: returns when Udx is NULL

2009-01-24 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.a4.oga.3

	* gaudx.c: simplied interface to grads main code, added
	  API level to udxt
	* gex.h: added (replaces gapi.h)
	* grads.c: call to gaudc() for initialization
	* gauser.c: call to gaudc()
	* gafunc.c: call to gaudf()

2009-01-07 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.a4.oga.2

	* re.c: eliminated debugging printouts when doing gaussian
	  interpolation
	* gagui.c: updated CmdStr calback: because GetStr() no longer
	  works reliably, a hand coded replacement was adopted
	* main_win32.c: GrADSGui now loads "default.gui"

2009-01-02 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.a4.oga.1

	* Merged GRADS2_DEV_BRANCH with COLA's v2.0.a4. The following
	  files have been updated: gaddes.c, gafunc.c, gagx.c, gaio.c,
	  galloc.c, gasdf.c, gauser.c, gautil.c, grib2scan.c, gscrpt.c,
	  gxeps.c, gxmeta.c, gxtran.c. All these files have been
	  replaced with COLA sources except for gauser.c where a Win32
	  patch differed (the OpenGrADS version of the patch was kept.)

	From COLA's ChangeLog:
	---------------------
        * Bugs:
	- Fixed function stnave(): error occurred when setting undef
	  mask for result if some reports were missing. Led to
	  incorrect averages!!
	- Fixed function asum(): error occurred when setting undef
	  mask for final result.  Led to answer being always
	  undefined!!
	- Fixed seg fault for non-templated netcdf files when X dim
	  wraps the globe and other dims are fixed.
	- No precision errors for some hourly GDS data sets.
	* Misc:
	- 'set frame circle' now works for orthograhic projections
	- Support for grib2 grid 204 (curvilinear orthogonal)
	- The color of a constant grid is whatever 'set ccolor' is,
          instead of being fixed red
	- The 'q ctlinfo' and 'q file' output is enhanced and more
	  accurate. (This one helps GDS 2.0 know when a data set is 4D
	  or 5D.)
	- Create postscript output from inside GrADS using 'print'
	  command without 'enable print'

	OpenGrADS local patches: 
	-----------------------
        * gafunc.c: added function re(), implemented in file re.c;
	  Makefile.am updated accordingtly.
	
	* Java: initial work towards Java build using NestedVM (Note: it
	  does not build out-of-the-box yet.)
	- grads.c: added ifdefs for __nestedvm__ 
        - gxJava.c: added, implements bridge for graphics primitives
	  in Java
	- gxJ.java: added, Java implementation of graphics primitives
	- JGrads.java: added, Java main program/bridge
	- GNUmakefile: targets for JVM build
	
2008-08-19 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.a3.oga.1
	* merged GRADS2_DEV_BRANCH with COLA's v2.0.a3. This time took
          COLA sources pretty much AS IS, except for
	  - Changed #include <config.h> to #include "config.h"
	  - Removed Arlindo's copyright notice in gacfg.c, kept COLA's 
	  - Changed Pixel to gaPixel in gatypes.h because of conflicts
	    with libsx.h
	  - Updated copyright notice in pcx11e.[ch]
	  - Changed main() to grads_main() in grads.c
	  - Introduced main.c and main_win32.c
	  - Commented out libdap_version() and libgadap_version() in gacfg.c
        * Implemented Win32 Superpack build
	* gscrpt.c, gauser.c: more CR/LF patches for win32
	* From COLAS e-mail announcing v2.0.a3...

        Features:
	* New set of commands for writing out netcdf files.  
          'sdfwrite'       (creates the file, takes a defined variable name as an argument) 
          'set sdfwrite'   (sets the output filename, default is grads.sdfwrite.nc) 
          'query sdfwrite' (shows the output filename, format, and user-specified attributes)
          'set sdfattr'    (sets attribute metadata for the output file) 
          'clear sdfwrite' (resets the sdf output filename and releases any attributes)
	* Added "PDEF GENERAL" as an data-format independent alternative to "PDEF FILE".

	Fixes: 
	* Station data handling via OPeNDAP (enabled with libgadap) works with GDS 2.0.
	* The stnmap utility does not seg fault when some templated data files are missing.
	* Added PDEF handling for 2-D native HDF and NetCDF files 
	* Data format dependence in PDEF FILE better documented;
          warning issued when data set that uses PDEF FILE is opened. 
	* Memory leak in scorr().
	* The index files created by gribmap are portable
	* parsing of VECTORPAIRS entry in descriptor file does not seq fault 

        Misc:
	* Graphical display window is sized according to the height of the display;
          portait is 90% of display height, landscape is 60%.
	* Changes to the configure tools to facilitate building from source 
        * The sdfopen command handles files with "axis" attribute
	* Output from 'query config' more complete, contains some supplib versions
	* Support for NetCDF and HDF files with spaces in the variable names;
          substitute ~ for <space> in varname=>alias syntax.

2008-05-10 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.a2.oga.1
	* merged GRADS2_DEV_BRANCH with COLA's v2.0.a2.
	* From COLAS e-mail announcing v2.0.a2:
	    Features:
	    * ready for use with GDS-2.0 to access 5-dimensional data 
	      sets via OPeNDAP
	    * support for thinned grib2 grids 
	    * gribmap has -0 option for grib2
	    * allows non-float data types for hdf coordinate axes 
	    Bug Fixes:
	    * memory leak when replacing an existing defined variable
	    * multiple fixes for netcdf/hdf handling (templating, 
	      zrev, %nodim%, et al.)
	    * contour interval and label handling for double precision numbers
	    * changed 'query dims' output for ensembles
	    * fixed gribmap's handling of data sets templated over T but not E
	    * fixed 'set annot' command and other minor bugs
	* Added Grib-2 specific tests to pytests/
	* gautil.c: patched getvnm() so that it can handle HDF-EOS variable
	names with spaces in them. In the ctl the user specifies '~' where 
	a space would go, making this a one liner patch.
	* src/gagx.c: Enhancements to fwrite in function gafwrt():
	    * When fwrite output file name is "-" output is sent to STDOUT
	    * Now uses stat() rather fopen(...,"r") to check is the file already
		exists. This is important for using fwrite on FIFOs - a deadlock
		occurs if a FIFO is opened for both read/write by a process.
	
2008-02-13 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.a1.oga.1
	* merged GRADS2_DEV_BRANCH with COLA's v2.0.a1
	* bug fixes since v2.0.a0 as reported by COLA
	0. Detection of linear and wrapping axes for netcdf 
	   files opened with sdfopen
	1. GRIB2 grids that have a bitmap were being drawn upside down
	2. Fixed display for gxout=model and gxout=grid
	3. Fixed handling of templated netcdf data sets opened with xdfopen
	4. Fixed detection of unlimited axis in hdf files opened with sdfopen
	5. Fixed I/O of PDEF files
	6. Fix to gribmap when creating index files >250mb 
	7. Added some debug statements for detection of errors in calls 
	   to seekgb() in the grib2c library. 

2008-01-31 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.a0.oga.1
	* This version temporarily placed under GRADS2_DEV_BRANCH
	* Adapted build mechanism from v1.9.0-rc1 for v2.0.a0
	* grads.h: no longer includes gasdf.h, and gasdf prototypes have
	been moved into gasdf.h. This is important to avoid including
	"netcdf.h" from NetCDF when building with NC-DAP (OPeNDAP
	implementation of NetCDF).
	* gagui.c, gsgui.c: replaced with v1.9.0-rc1 to cope with new
	supplibs, also revised license terms to GPL 2
	* gatypes.h: renamed Pixel->gaPixel to avoid conflict with new supplibs. 
	* grads.c: changed main() to Main() for Win32; added main.c, main_win32.c
	* GNUmakefile: added for Win32
	* w32_dist.csh: added for Win32
	* pcx11e.[ch]: updated license to GPL
	* gacfg.c: removed (c) 1997 Arlindo da Silva + old, unclear, license terms

2008-01-31 <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version GrADS 2.0.a0
	* Imported Version 2.0.a0 sources from COLA into COLA vendor branch.
