<H2><B>set x|y|z|t</B></H2><P>
<code>set x|y|z|t <i>val1 &lt;val2&gt;</i></code><p>
This sets one dimension of the dimension environment using grid
coordinates. You may use whatever coordinates are convenient to you.
Issuing <code>set lon</code> is equivalent to issuing <code>set x</code>,
both set the <code>x</code> dimension. The difference is only the units
you wish to enter the command in. <p>

When you enter just one value, that dimension is said to be "fixed". When
you enter two values, that dimension is said to be "varying". The
combination of fixed and varying dimensions defines the dimension
environment. <p>
<H3>Usage Notes</H3><P>
An important note: When you enter dimensions in grid coordinates, they are
always converted to world coordinates. This conversion requires some
knowledge of what scaling is in use for grid to world conversions. The
scaling that is used in all cases (except one) is the scaling of the
DEFAULT FILE. The exception is when you supply a dimension expression
within a variable specification, which will be covered later. <p>
<H3>Examples</H3><P>
<code>set t 1</code> (sets time to the first time in the data set -- using
grid coordinates in this case. Time is now a fixed
dimension).
